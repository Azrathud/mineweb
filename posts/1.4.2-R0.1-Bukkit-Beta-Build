<p>The Beta Build for Bukkit came out, so I've added it to the server. Let me know how it goes. I'm getting a lot of lag right now, but maybe it's just me. You can always send a request to me for adding removing any plugins by shooting an email to <a href="mailto:admin@minecraft.azrathud.com">admin@minecraft.azrathud.com</a></p>
<p>If anyone wants to move back to the save right before the transition to vanilla due to griefing, speak up now.</p>
