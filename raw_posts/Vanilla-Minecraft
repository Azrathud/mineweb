<p>The server will be using vanilla Minecraft with the new 1.4.2 update until a new Bukkit build is released. I have backed up the map just in case the map becomes horribly griefed; the spawn already has been griefed, but, since some people have built a lot in the past few days, we may still use the current map</p>
